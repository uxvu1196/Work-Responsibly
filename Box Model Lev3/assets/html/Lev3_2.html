            <h2>Decorating with plants is simple </h2>
            <p>To create the most interesting display, use a mixture of plant sizes and leaf shapes. A large plant like Pippa the peace lily, mixed with something sculptural like Susie the snake plant and a soft fern like Bertie fibes an attractive range of textures. Hanfing plants, like Rapunzel the golden pothos, add interest at different heights. Don't forget your pots. Matching pots will look clean and elegant, while a mix of styles and patterns look eclectic and fun <fun class=""></fun>
